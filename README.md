# BID4R
Senior project
Welcome to the BID4R Rover Model Project

Overview

The BID4R Rover Model is a project designed to develop an efficient power distribution and wireless charging system for a small swarm robot used in the Biologically Inspired Resilient Systems Test Arena (BIRSTA). The current system uses AA batteries, which only provide about 15 minutes of operational time, limiting the research capabilities of the system.

Our project focuses on upgrading one of the 50 swarm rovers to:

Use LiPo batteries to extend operational time to 60 minutes.
Implement a wireless charging station to eliminate manual recharging.
Optimize the rover's structure and design for improved performance and safety.
This proof-of-concept project serves as the foundation for future upgrades across the entire swarm.

Key Features

Power Distribution System: Upgrading the current system to a 3000 mAh LiPo battery.
Wireless Charging Protocol: Implementing a Qi wireless charging station to allow for easy, cable-free recharging.
Rover Design Enhancements: Reducing the rover structure from four tiers to three tiers for a simpler and more compact design.
3D-Printed Battery Mount: A custom-designed mount that ensures stability and protection for the battery and charging components.
Battery Monitoring Algorithm: Implementing software to track battery life, temperature, and optimize charging times to extend battery longevity.
Stakeholders

Primary Stakeholders: Dr. Watson and the Biologically-Inspired Design for Resilience Lab.
Secondary Stakeholders: Research teams working on robotic swarms and engineers interested in sustainable power systems for small-scale robots.
Project Goals

Develop and test the power distribution system using LiPo batteries.
Implement wireless charging on the rover and validate performance.
Showcase a continuous operation of 60 minutes using wireless charging.
Out of Scope

Modifications to the remaining 49 rovers in the swarm.
Autonomous navigation to charging stations.
